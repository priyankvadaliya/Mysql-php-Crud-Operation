Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) in PHP & MySQL
========

A complete CRUD system to add, edit, delete and view using PHP and MySQL. Complete in a sense that this system has login and register feature as well. I have another repository with Simple CRUD System which doesn't have login and register feature.

At first, users need to register and login. After successful login, users can add their product data. Users can see only those data that they have added.
